Get movie and series. That's it.

## Step 1

Go to Mullvad VPN, download OpenVPN files and add content to:

1. `vpn.crt` - certificate
2. `vpn.txt` - username and password

## Step 2 

Check everything in `.env` is correct.
Make sure to add your Plex claim token and that your paths are correct (are they pointing to your external hard drive?).

```
    docker compose up -d
```
